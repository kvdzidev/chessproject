# The Chess Project
The purpose of this project is to create a working chess game in the terminal, using c++(ncurses).

## Getting Started
Windows/Linux :ncurses lib

## Executing program
Just run the program and you should be able to play chess in your own terminal.

## Help
If you run up into any bugs/errors feel free to contact me, discord: kvdzi

## How to play
After you run the code, just type in the annotation of the move you are willing to make (standard eng annotation), e.g. Nc3 - will move your knight from B1 to C3.
### Things Worth Remembering
Remember that you have to play by the chess rules, it also works as a chess field, where you can set up positions and play for them so there are no limitations for pieces (only a few basic), so remember you can only move your pawn 2 squares forward only by the first move you make with it. To make an en-passant just move your pawn to the place you would take the pawn from and afterwards move your pawn 1 square up. In case to do the 0-0 just move your rook first to the square it is supposed to go to and afterwards move the king to its destinated place. Also, promoting your pawn to a different piece isnt available yet, unfortunately.
